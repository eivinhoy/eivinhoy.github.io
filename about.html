<h1>About me - Eivind HÃ¸ydal</h1>
<p>I am a consultant focused on cyber security, working in BCG Platinion, part of the Boston Consulting Group. I specialize in solving complex challenges at the intersection of technology, business, and people. I have a solid foundation in IT, technology, and cybersecurity with four years of consulting experience with clients in a variety of industries including energy, finance, infrastructure & transportation, technology, and the public sector.</p>

<p>When it comes to cyber security I currently focus on governance, organisation and process - the operating model. In my view these are foundational elements that need to be in place for organisations to succeed with cyber security. Enabling continuous improvement is key to secure environments. </p>
